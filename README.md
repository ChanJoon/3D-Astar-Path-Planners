This repo contains a series of Path Planning heuristic algorithms such as A*, Theta* and Lazy Theta*. The purpose of this repository is to provide som classes with a pure C++ implementation with the minimum dependencies, but at the same time, to provide ROS Integration to easily run these algorithms inside a ROS Network through some ROS Nodes.

Also take into account that the content of this repo is work-in-progress.

## Quick-Start

1. **Install ROS [Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu) or [Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)**

2. Downlaod Heuristic Path Planners: You can either download the source code or install the latest debian

- [Latest Release](https://github.com/robotics-upo/Heuristic_path_planners/releases)
- Clone the repo, install dependencies with rosdep and compile it with catkin
```bash
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/robotics-upo/Heuristic_path_planners
cd ..
rosdep update && rosdep install --from-paths src/ -y -r
catkin_make
```

3. Launch a demo a request a path


- 2D Theta*:
In one terminal:
```bash
roslaunch heuristic_planners planner2d_example.launch algorithm_name:=thetastar
```

Open another terminal and call an example start and goal request: 
```bash
rosservice call /planner_ros_node/request_path "start:
  x: 1.5
  y: 0.5
  z: 0.0
goal:
  x: 1.0
  y: 3.0
  z: 0.0" 
```
- 3D Lazy Theta*:

In one terminal:
```bash
roslaunch heuristic_planners planner2d_example.launch algorithm_name:=lazythetastar
```

Open another terminal and call an example start and goal request: 
```bash
rosservice call /planner_ros_node/request_path "start:
  x: 20.0
  y: 20.0
  z: 1.0
goal:
  x: 40.0
  y: 40.0
  z: 4.0" 
```

## Available Algorithms

Currently there are 5 algorithms:

- A*
- Cost Aware A*: Variation of A* that also takes into account a costmap 
- Theta*
- Lazy Theta*
- Cost Aware Lazy Theta*: Variaton of Lazy Theta* that also takes into account a costmap

Every algorithm is built has a shared library if you build the package without ROS and without DEBUG features.
If you build with the ROS features you can easily test all the algorithms above in the 2D / 3D variations through the included example ROS node. Please refer to the section [Running the demo ROS Node](#running-the-demo-ros-node).


## Code Documentation

By default the CMake BUILD_DOC option is enabled so the doxygen documentation will be generated every time you run catkin_make. You can also read it [Online](https://codedocs.xyz/robotics-upo/3D_heuristic_path_planners)
## Dependencies

If you want to easily run it go to the [Releases](https://github.com/RafaelRey/Heuristic_path_planners/releases) and download and install the desired debian package with:

```bash
sudo apt install ./ros-$ROS_DISTRO-heuristic_planners....deb
```

But to compile everything you need a ROS Melodic/Noetic installation in Ubuntu 18.04/20.04. If you want to use only the algorithm libraries you need a compiler with C++17 support (Gcc 7 or newer). 

To easily install the dependencies, download the source code onto your catkin workspace source folder, after that go to the catkin workspace root folder and run:

```bash
rosdep update && rosdep install --from-paths src/ -y -r
```

Make sure you have sourced your ```devel/setup.bash``` in case you compile it or ```/opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash``` in case you installed it.

## Building

The build system is CMake. By default CMakeLists.txt is configured to build the package with the ROS Features and nodes. The debug features such as step by step explored nodes publications are disabled by default. To enable/disable them you can play with the the CMake options at the beginning of the CMakeLists:

```CMake
option(BUILD_DOC         "Build documentation   " ON)
option(BUILD_ROS_SUPPORT "Build with ROS Support" ON)
option(BUILD_DEBUG       "Build debug features  " ON)
```

For production uses and real tests you should set **debug features** to **OFF**, because it increases a lot the computation time because of the marker messages sending. Debians files on the Release tab are compiled only with the ROS Support, not with the debug features.

## Running the demo ROS Node 

The algorithms can be used for 2D and 3D. 2D is a special case of the 3D world size configuration. The world size Z must be equal to the resolution of the map, and the start/goals coordinates should have a 0 z component. The main internal difference for the algorithms is the number of directions that can be used to explore the space, that is 8 in 2D and 26 in 3D.

Also, the header ROSInterfaces.hpp include two interfaces to load PointClouds and OccupancyGrid as maps, for the 3D and 2D cases.

To easily run the algorithms, some launch files are provided for ROS Nodes. Also 2D maps and 3D maps are provided 

### 3D Lazy Theta*

```bash
roslaunch heuristic_planners planner.launch algorithm_name:=lazythetastar
```

### 2D Theta*

```bash
roslaunch heuristic_planners planner2d_example.launch algorithm_name:=thetastar
```

#### Parameters

You can pass some args to the launchs files such as:

- *map*: The .bt file path, by default the mbzirc challenge3
- *algorithm_name*: Can be "astar", "thetastar" or "lazythetastar" for the moment. At startup the node will echo the selected one to make you sure you are using the one you want. 
- *world_size_x*: world x size in meters 
- *world_size_y*: world y size in meters 
- *world_size_z*: world z size in meters
- *resolution*: Resolution of the map in meters 
- *inflate_map*: Boolean to inflate or not the map 
- *inflation_size*: The inflation size (It's performed as an isotropic inflation in x,y,z). By default is the same as the resolution because it's recommended as minimum inflation to fill empty blocks between cells and avoid bad paths crosing walls etc.
- *save_data*: Boolean to enable data saving
- *data_file_path*: Path of the data file, by default $HOME/planning.txt. It saves algorithm name, start and goal coordinates, explored nodes, time etc.


In the 3D case, it will open an RViz window an load the default map *mbzirc_challenge3* in the folder ```resources/3dmaps```. First time you open a map the Grid3 class will compute the gridmap so you will need to wait a little bit before starting.

To request path you need to call the service ```/planner_ros_node/request_path``` filling the start and goal coordinates in meters(m). 

# Included Maps

The repository includes some 3D and 2D maps for testing purposes. They can be found in the ```resources/3maps``` and ```resources/2dmaps``` folders. 
The included maps are the following ones:
